# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This is a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

- What was your motivation?
To be able to give users a clean and concise way to organize their day with as little effort as possible. 
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not \"Because it was a homework assignment.")
I built this project to further hone my strengths in these coding languages, as well as to continue my exploration of figuring out how to use said languages as novel solutions to simple problems.
- What problem does it solve?
It solves the problem of not having a quick and easy way to organize your time. 
- What did you learn?
I learned how to utilize the day.js library and its utility as time-based component of a project like this. 

## Installation

To get the development enviroment running, you must make sure you have js and day.js within it. As long as that's sorted, then  all you need to do is right click open the index so it shows in the browser. 

## Usage

You open the app and are greeted with entry blocks for hours 9am-5pm. You can log what you want to do - or have already done - within these boxes. This will save to local storage and be accessible to you anytime you open the app to check again. The white blocks represent time that's behind you, red is your current hour, and green is the time ahead of you.
